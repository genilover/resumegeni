          <h4>Wireless Power Transmission Using Wardenclyff Tower</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p> The Wardenclyffe Tower, built in Shoreham, New York near James Warden’s resort, Wardenclyffe-on-Sound, wasn't originally meant to be used for wireless power transfer. Initially, John Pierpont (J.P.) Morgan intended to use it as part of an investment into a wireless communications system.

            At the time, Guglielmo Marconi was transmitting yachting race results from ocean liners. Morgan thought having race results and news transmitted from America to London would be the next step. He wanted a better system than Marconi’s—and Tesla was happy to have the backing of such an influential person.</p>
